### Description
The NASA Psyche Web Game is a 2D top-down scavenger hunt game developed to increase public knowledge of the NASA Psyche mission. Players play as an astronaut, Psych-e, and their goal is to find parts of the Psyche spacecraft, which are scattered around the NASA warehouse. As players retrieve these parts, they learn about the specific functions of each part through descriptions and images of said parts.

The project’s functionality and assets are contained within the Assets folder. Each folder within the Assets folder is organized based on the functions that they contribute to the game. The following descriptions outline the contents of each subfolder:
Artwork: contains the artwork that is included in the game
Minigames: contains artwork and materials that are used to develop the minigame
Prefabs: contains prefab objects that were created during game development
Scenes: contains game scenes
Scripts: contains all scripts that add different operations and functionality
TextMesh Pro: contains font information for in-game text
UI Elements: contains artwork used in developing the game UI

### Installation and Setup
To open the game locally, the game must be downloaded through github. The unity editor must be downloaded, and the specific editor version used to develop the game was 2021.3.18f1. Once all prerequisite programs and files are downloaded, the project can be opened through Unity Hub. In Unity Hub, a button to open an existing project should be visible.

Click on this button and navigate to the folder where the project was downloaded to, and open the project. The project should take a couple minutes to load.

The game can be run within the Unity Editor, but can also be built through WebGL. Within the Unity Editor, go to File > Build Settings, and make sure that WebGL is selected.

If the Build and Run button is grayed out, make sure to select “Switch Platform” first. To build and run the game, select the Build and Run button. The game will be built within a few minutes, and the game should be running in a local web server once it is done being built.
